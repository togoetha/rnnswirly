# Code repository for ANN components for SoSwirly

- Generator\: contains a C#.Net project that generates samples from edge node (car) tripes, and SoSwirly QoE numbers to compare to the RNN output. Form1 generates training samples (see generatorsettings.txt for settings used for paper). Form3 calculates best nodes based on RNN QoE prediction vs default Swirly behavior.
- distmetric.py: contains generators for both metrics used in the paper, generates a configurable amount of training and evaluation samples and outputs the evaluation results + ground truth to csv
- rnn2.py: the RNN for QoE prediction, requires input files pathmetrics.csv (6 days' worth of simulated samples) for training and switchy/normal/busymetrics.csv as evaluation samples (configurable in code)
- qosoutputs_: files generated by the RNN for the three scenarios in the paper; switchy/normal/busy (high edge node density). Used as input for Form3, together with the metrics.csv files.
